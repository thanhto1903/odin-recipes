    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Building a great lasagna is less about a strict formula and more about the
      art of the architecture. It begins with a robust Bolognese or marinara
      sauce, simmered slowly with aromatics like garlic and onions to develop a
      deep, savory base. While the sauce provides the soul of the dish, the
      structural integrity comes from layers of wide, flat pasta noodles. These
      act as the "foundation" between a creamy cheese mixture—typically a blend
      of ricotta, egg, and parsley, or a silky Béchamel sauce if you’re leaning
      into the traditional Northern Italian style.

    <p>
      The magic happens in the assembly. You start with a thin layer of sauce to
      prevent sticking, followed by a repetitive pattern of noodles, cheese, and
      more sauce. To achieve that iconic, bubbly golden crust, the top is
      generously blanketed with shredded mozzarella and freshly grated Parmesan.
      After baking covered for about 45 minutes to tenderize the pasta, a final
      stint uncovered allows the cheese to caramelize and the edges to crisp.
      The most crucial ingredient, however, is patience: letting the lasagna
      rest for 15 minutes after it leaves the oven ensures the layers set
      perfectly, preventing it from sliding apart on the plate.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 lb Ground Beef</li>
      <li>1/2 lb Italian Sausage</li>
      <li>1 Large Onion, finely diced</li>
      <li>3-4 Cloves Garlic, minced</li>
      <li>28 oz Crushed Tomatoes</li>
      <li>12 oz Tomato Paste</li>
      <li>15 oz Tomato Sauce</li>
      <li>2 tbsp White Sugar</li>
      <li>12-15 Lasagna Noodles</li>
      <li>1 lb Mozzarella Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prep the Sauce: In a large pot, brown the ground beef and Italian
        sausage with the onions and garlic; drain the excess fat, then stir in
        the tomato products and seasonings. Let it simmer on low for at least
        30–45 minutes to develop a rich flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil the Noodles: Cook your lasagna noodles in a large pot of salted
        boiling water until they are al dente (slightly firm). Drain them and
        lay them out flat on parchment paper or foil to prevent them from
        sticking together while you prep.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the Cheese: In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with the
        beaten egg, chopped parsley, and a pinch of salt. Stir until the mixture
        is smooth and well-incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer the Base: Spread about 1 cup of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13
        inch baking dish. Lay 3 or 4 noodles over the sauce, followed by a layer
        of the ricotta mixture, a sprinkle of mozzarella, and more meat sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat and Top: Continue the layering pattern (noodles, ricotta,
        mozzarella, sauce) until you reach the top of the dish. For the final
        layer, cover the noodles with the remaining sauce and a generous blanket
        of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Cover the dish tightly with foil (pro tip: spray the foil with oil
        so the cheese doesn't stick) and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes.
        Remove the foil and bake for another 20–25 minutes until the cheese is
        bubbly and browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest: Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it sit for 15–20 minutes
        before cutting. This allows the sauce to thicken and the layers to set
        so the lasagna doesn't fall apart.
      </li>
    </ol>
