    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Building a great lasagna is less about a strict formula and more about the
      art of the architecture. It begins with a robust Bolognese or marinara
      sauce, simmered slowly with aromatics like garlic and onions to develop a
      deep, savory base. While the sauce provides the soul of the dish, the
      structural integrity comes from layers of wide, flat pasta noodles. These
      act as the "foundation" between a creamy cheese mixture—typically a blend
      of ricotta, egg, and parsley, or a silky Béchamel sauce if you’re leaning
      into the traditional Northern Italian style.

      The magic happens in the assembly. You start with a thin layer of sauce to
      prevent sticking, followed by a repetitive pattern of noodles, cheese, and
      more sauce. To achieve that iconic, bubbly golden crust, the top is
      generously blanketed with shredded mozzarella and freshly grated Parmesan.
      After baking covered for about 45 minutes to tenderize the pasta, a final
      stint uncovered allows the cheese to caramelize and the edges to crisp.
      The most crucial ingredient, however, is patience: letting the lasagna
      rest for 15 minutes after it leaves the oven ensures the layers set
      perfectly, preventing it from sliding apart on the plate.
