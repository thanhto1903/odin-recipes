      <h2>Description</h2>

      <p>
        Making a great pizza is all about the balance between a chewy, charred
        crust and high-quality, simple toppings. It starts with the dough, a
        living thing that benefits from a slow fermentation to develop complex,
        yeasty flavors and that perfect "leopard-spotting" when baked. While the
        dough provides the canvas, the sauce acts as the vibrant lead, often
        kept simple with crushed San Marzano tomatoes, a touch of salt, and
        maybe a drizzle of olive oil to let the fruitiness of the tomatoes shine
        through.
      </p>

      <p>
        The assembly is where technique meets personal flair. A light touch is
        key—overloading a pizza with too many toppings can lead to a soggy
        center. The cheese, traditionally fresh mozzarella or a low-moisture
        shred, should be scattered just enough to melt into the sauce without
        drowning it. High heat is your best friend here; whether you’re using a
        dedicated pizza oven or a preheated baking stone in a conventional oven,
        the goal is a rapid bake that crisps the bottom while keeping the inside
        of the crust airy and light.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Dough: 3 ½ cups bread flour (or "00" flour), 1 ½ cups warm water, 2 ¼
          tsp active dry yeast, 2 tsp salt, and 1 tbsp olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          1Sauce: 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 tsp
          dried oregano, and a pinch of salt.
        </li>
        <li>
          Toppings: 1 lb shredded mozzarella, fresh basil leaves, and your
          choice of meats (like pepperoni) or vegetables.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Bloom the Yeast: Stir the yeast and a pinch of sugar into warm water
          and let it sit for about 5–10 minutes until it becomes frothy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knead the Dough: Mix the flour, salt, and olive oil with the yeast
          water, then knead by hand or mixer for 7–10 minutes until the dough is
          smooth and elastic.
        </li>
        <li>
          The First Rise: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it, and
          let it rise in a warm spot for 1.5 to 2 hours (or until doubled in
          size).
        </li>
        <li>
          Shape the Crust: Gently punch down the dough and divide it; stretch it
          out by hand or with a rolling pin on a floured surface to your desired
          thickness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sauce and Cheese: Spread a thin layer of sauce over the dough,
          followed by a light blanket of mozzarella and your favorite toppings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake at High Heat: Slide the pizza onto a preheated stone or tray in
          an oven set to its highest temperature (usually 475°F to 500°F) and
          bake for 10–15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finish and Serve: Remove when the crust is golden and the cheese is
          bubbly; add fresh basil or a drizzle of olive oil before slicing.
        </li>
      </ol>
