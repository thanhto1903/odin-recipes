    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Fried chicken is the ultimate masterclass in contrast—achieving a
      shatteringly crisp, golden-brown exterior while keeping the meat inside
      incredibly succulent and tender. The secret lies in the brining process,
      where the chicken is soaked in seasoned buttermilk for several hours. This
      doesn't just flavor the meat to the bone; the lactic acid in the
      buttermilk breaks down proteins, ensuring every bite is juicy. The "crunch
      factor" comes from the dredge, a seasoned flour mixture that, when pressed
      into the wet chicken, creates those craggy, irregular bits that turn into
      "flavor crystals" once they hit the oil.

    <p>
      Frying is where the chemistry happens. Using an oil with a high smoke
      point, like peanut or vegetable oil, allows you to maintain the high
      temperatures necessary for a quick sear without burning. The goal is a
      steady sizzle—too hot and the skin burns before the meat is cooked; too
      cool and the breading absorbs the oil, becoming greasy. A final rest on a
      wire rack instead of paper towels is the pro move, as it prevents steam
      from trapped underneath, keeping the bottom just as crunchy as the top.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Chicken: 3–4 lbs of bone-in, skin-on chicken pieces (thighs and
        drumsticks are the juiciest).
      </li>
      <li>
        The Marinade: 2 cups buttermilk, 1 tbsp hot sauce (optional), 1 tsp
        salt, and 1 tsp black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Seasoned Flour: 3 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup cornstarch (for
        extra crunch), 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tbsp onion powder, 1 tbsp
        paprika, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, and 2 tsp salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Oil: 1 quart (or more) of Peanut, Canola, or Vegetable oil for
        frying.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Marinate/Brine: Submerge the chicken pieces in the seasoned buttermilk
        mixture and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (overnight is even better)
        to tenderize the meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the Dredge: In a large bowl or shallow dish, whisk together the
        flour, cornstarch, and all the dry spices until well-combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coat the Chicken: Remove a piece of chicken from the buttermilk, let the
        excess drip off, and coat it thoroughly in the flour; press the flour
        firmly onto the meat to create those signature "craggy" bits. size).
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the Oil: Fill a heavy Dutch oven or deep skillet about halfway with
        oil and heat it to 350°F (175°C); use a thermometer to ensure the
        temperature stays consistent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry in Batches: Carefully lower 3–4 pieces of chicken into the oil,
        being careful not to crowd the pan, which would drop the temperature and
        lead to greasiness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Monitor the Temp: Fry the chicken for 12–15 minutes, turning
        occasionally, until the crust is deep golden brown and the internal
        temperature reaches 165°F (74°C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain and Rest: Place the finished chicken on a wire cooling rack over a
        baking sheet for at least 10 minutes to let the juices redistribute and
        the crust fully set.
      </li>
    </ol>
